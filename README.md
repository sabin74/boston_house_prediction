# Boston Housing Price Prediction

## Project Overview

This project aims to predict the median value of owner-occupied homes in Boston suburbs using various machine learning regression models.

Multiple regression techniques were applied, including Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting and dimensionality reduction with PCA. Hyperparameter tuning was performed to improve the modelâ€™s accuracy.


## Tools & Technologies

- **Language:** Python 3.x
- **Libraries:**  
  - numpy, pandas  
  - scikit-learn  
  - matplotlib, seaborn  
  - joblib (for saving/loading models)


4. **Model Building**  
   Trained various regression models:
   - Linear Regression  
   - Decision Tree Regressor  
   - Random Forest Regressor  
   - Gradient Boosting Regressor (best performing)
